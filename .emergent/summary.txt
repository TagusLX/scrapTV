<analysis>
The AI engineer's work revolved around building and enhancing a full-stack web application to scrape real estate data from idealista.pt. The trajectory highlights an iterative development process, starting with core scraping functionality and progressively addressing complex issues like web scraping detection, data presentation, and user interface enhancements. Key technical challenges included persistent 403 Forbidden errors, requiring multiple iterations of anti-bot strategies (stealth headers, Selenium with human-like profiles, undetected-chromedriver, residential proxies, and ultra-human behavior). The engineer consistently integrated user feedback for features like hierarchical data display, filtering, detailed statistics, and targeted scraping. The primary focus remained on accurate data extraction and a robust, user-friendly application, with a strong emphasis on debugging and refining scraping techniques to overcome sophisticated website defenses.

<product_requirements>
The initial requirement was to scrape real estate sale and rental prices from idealista.pt, specifically the *average price per square meter* for apartments, houses, and plots (urban and agricultural). The application needs to cover all Portuguese regions following Idealista's administrative hierarchy (distritos, concelhos, freguesias). Core features include on-demand scraping, a monitoring system for scraping completeness, manual CAPTCHA entry, clean hierarchical display of administrative names in the UI (e.g., Faro e Tunes), and similar formatting for PHP export. Subsequent requests included filtering capabilities by administrative levels and property types, detailed statistics by property type and operation (sale/rent), direct links to data sources, targeted manual scraping for specific regions, and robust anti-bot measures to ensure only real, non-simulated data is collected, explicitly targeting the Preço médio nesta zona element.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Web Scraping**: , , Selenium (with ), stealth headers, user-agent rotation, human-like behavior, residential proxies.
- **Data Handling**: Pydantic for models, Motor for MongoDB.
- **UI/UX**: Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, responsive design.
- **Error Handling**: Detailed logging for scraping failures (403, 429, CAPTCHA), retry mechanisms.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack architecture:



- **/app/backend/server.py**: The core backend logic.
    - **Importance**: Defines FastAPI app, MongoDB connection, Pydantic models (Property, Session, RegionalStats, etc.), API endpoints, and comprehensive scraping logic. It handles administrative structure, CAPTCHA, PHP export, and now advanced anti-bot strategies.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Implemented initial API endpoints (, , , , ).
        - Added CAPTCHA handling endpoints.
        - Implemented hybrid scraping (Selenium, , then simulated data fallback, eventually removed simulated data).
        - Modified scraping to extract  from Preço médio nesta zona.
        - Integrated administrative hierarchy and coverage monitoring.
        - Added  with 29 districts.
        - Introduced administrative API endpoints for hierarchical data.
        - Implemented name formatting utility functions for UI/export.
        - Added  and  models.
        - Created new endpoints: , , , , .
        - Enhanced error capturing and logging for scraping failures (403, 429).
        - Implemented a  class with advanced anti-bot techniques (random delays, rotating User-Agents, realistic headers, human-like navigation, residential proxies, , JavaScript/image blocking).
        - Removed all simulated data, relying solely on scraped data.

- **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.
    - **Importance**: Lists all Python packages required for the backend.
    - **Changes Made**: Added  and usage: websockets [--version | <uri>] for advanced scraping.

- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component.
    - **Importance**: Renders the dashboard, handles user interactions, displays scraped data, statistics, and filtering options.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Implemented dashboard tabs (Overview, Sessions, Properties, Statistics, and a new Couverture tab).
        - Added UI for scraping, export, clear data, and CAPTCHA input.
        - Displayed  and .
        - Integrated coverage statistics and hierarchical display.
        - Fixed JSX compilation errors and  empty value bug.
        - Implemented filtering UI by Distrito, Concelho, Freguesia, Operation Type, and Property Type.
        - Added functions to generate Idealista URLs and property-specific URLs.
        - Enhanced property type display in Properties tab and added summary by type in Statistics.
        - Implemented UI for targeted scraping and detailed coverage statistics.
        - Added error display and retry functionality in sessions view.
        - Fixed a bug where the targeted scraping button was not triggering due to state management.

- **/app/frontend/src/components/ui/select.jsx**: Shadcn UI component for dropdowns.
    - **Importance**: Provides reusable select dropdown UI elements for filtering.
    - **Changes Made**: Used for implementing the filtering dropdowns.

- **/app/backend/.env, /app/frontend/.env**: Environment variable files.
    - **Importance**: Store critical configurations like  and . These are not modified.

<pending_tasks>
- **Continue Anti-Detection Improvement**: The scraper is still getting blocked despite advanced stealth techniques. The last reported issue was le scraper ne retourne rien il se fait bloquer.
- **Display Administrative List**: The user explicitly requested to Affiche la liste des distritos, concelhos et freguesias (Display the list of districts, concelhos and freguesias).

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on drastically improving the web scraping method to bypass Idealista's highly sophisticated anti-bot protections, which were causing persistent 403 Forbidden errors and resulting in the scraper returning no data. This involved implementing ultra-human techniques in the  file, building upon previous iterations that included , residential proxies, and advanced session management. The goal was to make the scraping behavior as indistinguishable from a real human user as possible, focusing on further modifications to HTTP headers and navigation patterns. Immediately after implementing these new techniques, the user reported that the scraper was still getting blocked and requested to drastically improve the method to scrape anonymously like a human. The very last explicit request from the user was to Affiche la liste des distritos, concelhos et freguesias (Display the list of districts, concelhos and freguesias), which the AI acknowledged and was about to perform. The scraper is currently stuck at a point where it is getting blocked even after all the ultra-stealth techniques were implemented.
