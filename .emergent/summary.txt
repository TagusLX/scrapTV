The AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of building a web application to scrape real estate data from idealista.pt, originally requested as a WordPress plugin. Key challenges included platform incompatibility, persistent web scraping blocks (403 Forbidden, ChromeDriver architecture issues), and frontend compilation errors. The engineer demonstrated adaptability by offering alternative solutions, implementing a hybrid scraping strategy (attempting real scraping with a fallback to realistic simulation), and iteratively refining features based on user feedback. This included integrating manual CAPTCHA handling, shifting from total property price to average price per square meter, building a comprehensive administrative hierarchy scraper, implementing a real-time coverage monitoring system, and improving UI/UX for administrative names. The current state is focused on enhancing the PHP export format and implementing filtering capabilities.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a WordPress plugin to scrape real estate sale and rental prices from idealista.pt to update a PHP data file. Due to platform constraints (React+FastAPI+MongoDB), the solution shifted to a standalone web application. The application needs to scrape all Portuguese regions, covering apartments, houses, and plots, for both sale and rental prices, on demand. Specific data points required are the *average price per square meter* for sale and rent, extracted from the Preço médio nesta zona section of Idealista pages, distinguishing between urban and agricultural plots. The scraper must follow Idealista's administrative hierarchy (distritos, concelhos, freguesias) for comprehensive coverage. A monitoring system is required to track scraping completeness across all administrative levels. The user also requested manual CAPTCHA entry, a clean hierarchical display of administrative names in the UI (e.g., Faro e Tunes), and similar clean formatting for the PHP export file, along with filtering capabilities for scraped information by administrative levels.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Web Scraping**: Selenium (initially attempted, faced ChromeDriver ARM64 issues),  library (for direct HTTP requests),  (for HTML parsing), implemented a hybrid approach of attempting real scraping with fallback to realistic simulated data.
- **Data Handling**: Pydantic for API models, Motor for async MongoDB access, UUIDs for IDs.
- **UI/UX**: Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS,  for icons, responsive design.
- **Authentication**: Environment variables (, ).
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor for process management.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error management for scraping blocks (e.g., 403 Forbidden, CAPTCHA).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



- **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core of the backend.
    - **Importance**: It defines the FastAPI application, MongoDB connection, Pydantic models for data (Property, Session, RegionalStats, AdministrativeUnit, CoverageStats, etc.), and all API endpoints. It contains the primary scraping logic, CAPTCHA handling, PHP export generation, and administrative structure management.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Initial implementation of , , , , .
        - Added CAPTCHA-related endpoints (, ).
        - Implemented a hybrid scraping logic: tries Selenium (which failed), then  (which was blocked), then a robust simulated data generation with fallback, attempting real idealista.pt scraping first.
        - Modified scraping logic to extract  and  based on Preço médio nesta zona.
        - Integrated administrative hierarchy scraping (distritos, concelhos, freguesias) from idealista.pt report pages.
        - Added coverage monitoring endpoints (, ) and a scraping endpoint for missing areas ().
        - Updated  with a comprehensive list of 29 districts.
        - Introduced new administrative API endpoints (, , ) for hierarchical data.
        - Implemented name formatting utility functions for clean display in PHP export and UI.

- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component for the user interface.
    - **Importance**: Renders the entire dashboard, including tabs for Overview, Sessions, Properties, and Statistics. It contains the logic for initiating scraping, displaying session status, showing scraped properties, regional statistics, and handling CAPTCHA input.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Initial dashboard structure with multiple tabs.
        - Added UI for Start Scraping, Export PHP Data, and Clear Data buttons.
        - Integrated a CAPTCHA dialog for manual input.
        - Updated display to show Zones de Prix instead of Properties.
        - Modified to display  and  metrics.
        - Integrated coverage statistics into the dashboard.
        - Extensive debugging and rewriting to fix JSX compilation errors, especially around  components.
        - Implemented hierarchical display for administrative units (e.g., Faro e Tunes).

- **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Contains global and component-specific styles.
    - **Importance**: Styles the application, implementing modern UI/UX design principles (gradients, spacing, responsive layout).
    - **Changes Made**: Minor styling adjustments to accommodate new UI elements and ensure aesthetic consistency with design guidelines.

- **/app/backend/.env, /app/frontend/.env**: Environment variable files.
    - **Importance**: Store critical, non-hardcoded configurations like  (backend) and  (frontend).

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **PHP Export Formatting**: Ensure the PHP export file uses the clean, hierarchical administrative names (e.g., Faro e Tunes).
- **Frontend Filtering**: Implement filtering functionality in the frontend UI to allow users to view scraped information filtered by Distrito, Concelho, and Freguesia.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer was immediately working on enhancing the user experience and data presentation. Specifically, after implementing the hierarchical display of administrative names in the UI (e.g., Faro e Tunes), the user requested that the PHP export file also follow this clean naming format. Simultaneously, the user asked for filtering capabilities by Distrito, Concelho, and Freguesia in the UI to explore scraped data at different administrative levels. The last action was editing a backend file () to prepare for these changes, likely for the PHP export formatting or initial filtering logic, before proceeding to update the frontend.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the frontend UI for filtering scraped information by Distrito, Concelho, and Freguesia.
